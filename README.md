# Project Description

My task was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the IKEA dataset and build a model to predict furniture prices. 
Hereâ€™s what I did:

1. Data Loading:
I downloaded the IKEA dataset, which contains information about furniture, including prices, categories, sizes, and other characteristics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I performed a detailed exploratory data analysis of the dataset, including:
- Descriptive statistics such as mean values, medians, standard deviations, correlations, etc.
- Visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, correlation graphs, and others.
- I described the results of the analysis, identified trends, patterns, and possible anomalies.

4. Model Training for Price Prediction:
I trained a model to predict furniture prices based on the provided data:
- Identified which columns should not be included in the model and explained the reasons for their exclusion.
- Created a cross-validation pipeline for model training and evaluation, including steps such as handling missing values and data normalization.
- Proposed methods to improve model performance and described the results of the modeling, including model accuracy, important features, and potential enhancements.

In summary, I provided a detailed report on all stages of analysis and modeling, discussed the results obtained, and drew conclusions about the effectiveness of the built model.
